In this article, we will give you a brief overview of some of the main topics covered in the book by John F. Wakerly. These topics are:
 
- Number systems and codes: This topic introduces the binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems, and how to convert between them. It also explains the concept of codes, such as ASCII, BCD, Gray code, and Hamming code, and how to encode and decode information using them.
- Digital circuits: This topic explains the basic components of digital circuits, such as logic gates, flip-flops, latches, registers, counters, multiplexers, decoders, encoders, and adders. It also shows how to use Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps to simplify and optimize digital circuits.
- Combinational logic design principles: This topic covers the design of combinational logic circuits, which are circuits that produce outputs based on the current inputs only. It discusses the methods of functional decomposition, modular design, hierarchical design, regular structures, and standard modules. It also introduces some common combinational logic devices, such as comparators, parity generators and checkers, magnitude comparators, code converters, and arithmetic logic units.
- Sequential logic design principles: This topic covers the design of sequential logic circuits, which are circuits that produce outputs based on the current inputs and the previous states. It discusses the concepts of state machines, state diagrams, state tables, state minimization, state assignment, and state encoding. It also introduces some common sequential logic devices, such as shift registers, counters, sequence detectors, sequence generators, and memory elements.
- Register-transfer-level logic design: This topic covers the design of register-transfer-level (RTL) logic circuits, which are circuits that operate on groups of bits (registers) and transfer them between different functional units. It discusses the concepts of data paths, control units, microoperations, microinstructions, and microprograms. It also introduces some common RTL logic devices, such as arithmetic and logic units (ALUs), multipurpose registers (MPRs), program counters (PCs), instruction registers (IRs), memory address registers (MARs), memory data registers (MDRs), and input/output ports.
- Digital system design: This topic covers the design of digital systems that consist of multiple RTL logic circuits that communicate with each other and with external devices. It discusses the concepts of buses,
interfaces,
protocols,
synchronization,
handshaking,
and arbitration.
It also introduces some common digital system devices,
such as microprocessors,
microcontrollers,
digital signal processors (DSPs),
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs),
and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).
- Programmable logic devices: This topic covers the design of programmable logic devices (PLDs),
which are devices that can be configured to implement any desired digital circuit.
It discusses the types,
features,
and advantages of PLDs,
such as programmable read-only memories (PROMs),
programmable array logics (PALs),
programmable logic arrays (PLAs),
complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs),
and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
It also shows how to use hardware description languages (HDLs),
such as Verilog and VHDL,
to describe and simulate PLDs.
- Computer-aided design tools: This topic covers the use of computer-aided design (CAD) tools to assist in the design,
verification,
and testing of digital circuits and systems.
It discusses the types,
functions,
and benefits of CAD tools,
such as schematic capture tools,
simulation tools,
synthesis tools,
layout tools,
and testing tools.
It also shows how to use some popular CAD software packages,
such as Quartus II,
ModelSim,
Xilinx ISE,
and Cadence OrCAD.
- Testing and design for testability: This topic covers the techniques for testing digital circuits and systems to ensure their correct functionality and reliability.
It discusses the concepts of faults,
fault models,
fault detection,
fault location,
fault diagnosis,
and fault tolerance.
It also introduces some methods for designing digital circuits and systems that are easy to test,
such as scan design,
built-in self-test (BIST),
boundary scan test (BST),
and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG).

These are some of the main topics covered in Digital Design: Principles and Practices by John F. Wakerly. By reading this book, you will gain a solid understanding of the theory and practice of digital design. You will also learn how to apply your knowledge to design real-world digital systems using modern tools and
